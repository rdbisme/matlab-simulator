-------------PRELAUNCH CHECKLIST-----------

1) check coefficients for the controller algorithm
2) check the reference trajectories are generated for the correct target
3) check the reference trajectories are rescaled in the correct way (10m
steps)
4) check the shadow modes
5) check the sensors are correctly connected
6) check the sensors are correctly initialized in obs



------------parameters for euroc 2022----------

parameter       2021        2022


for next time: 
set the montecarlo so that it can give back some parameters of interest,
which are: 
+ montecarlo:
    - TIME at which we get to MACH.CONTROL -> VERY IMPORTANT for the shadow modes
    - TIME at which we get to apogee -> also very important for the shadow modes
    - set that multiplicative wind can work
+ write new members in the virginia sheet
+ set the requirements in the word file of requirements


thrust 1, time 1 -> tempo= 5.7 per mach 0.85, ( apogeo 2999)
thrust = 1.05, time = 1.05 -> tempo = 5.7 per mach 0.97 (apogeo 3475)
